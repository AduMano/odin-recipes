# ODIN RECIPES!

 I learned basic html structure and followed through the directions to make this simple website!
 Using HTML is already good for displaying or presenting information, what more if i learned CSS.
 Thanks Project Odin!

> ## Why with CSS?
> This is not part of the requirements in Odin's Recipes Project so you are to do what you are
told (By creating a html skeletal interface with no styles). Reason why this has design because
in the feature assignments, you are required to go back to this project and add styles into it
after learning css rules, css selectors and the specifity and precedence.
